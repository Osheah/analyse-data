Code is in Jupyter notebook format\

To download the code download the repo and open it in jupyter notebook by typing jupyter notebook at the command line.\
Contents of the repo are as follows
\
* images - directory to store images that are in the ipynb file (it contains on picture of MACB notation)* 
* analyse-data.ipynb - the main file
* base-rd-01-supertimeline.csv - not uploaded to github but required. This is the file that is analysed in the data and was taken from course material.
* baserd01-filesystem-timeline.csv - not uploaded to github - not required
* LICENSE - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version
* README.md - This readme file
* gitignore - I've set the gitignore to ignore the .csv files and i think i should move the images to a static repo and point to that when refering to images.
